This pixel is also suitable for very high-speed applications, such as fluorescence lifetime imaging (FLIM) used for drug discovery and/or minimally-invasive optical biopsy. In order to achieve high-speed imaging using single-photon detection, a detector with a very low dead-time is needed. The single-photon avalanche-photodiode (SPAD) discussed in this work uses a mainstream deep-submicron CMOS technology in order to achieve ultrahigh-speed operation and high pixel fill-factor, with in-pixel active quench and reset circuits. The paper also presents an innovative approach for reducing the deadtime of the detector and an attractive technique for simultaneous high-speed image acquisition by all the pixels of an array in parallel. © 2006 IEEE.},

   abstract = {The well-known analytical formula for the excess noise factor associated with avalanche photodiodes (APDs), developed by R. J. McIntyre in 1966, assumes the injection of either an electron or a hole at the edge of the APD's avalanche region. This formula is based on the statistics of the probabilities of carriers gaining and losing energy subject to high electric fields. However, this analytical formula, is not applicable in cases when photons are absorbed inside the avalanche region (even though the physics of the high field transport remains the same), and its use may severely underestimate or overestimate the actual excess noise factor depending on the absorption profile and the hole-to-electron ionization coefficient ratio, k. Here, an easy-to-use exact analytical formula is derived for the excess noise factor of APDs while taking into account a mixed-carrier initiated avalanche multiplication process, which is triggered by a parent electron-hole pair at an arbitrarily specified location within the multiplication region. The derivation relies on analytically solving a special case of a previously reported recursive integral equations [Hayat et al., IEEE Trans. Electron Devices, vol. 39, no. 3, pp. 546-552, Mar. 1992.], and the result matches the formula reported by McIntyre in 1999 using a different and limited technique. In addition, an expression for the excess noise factor is presented in the case when the location of the parent electron-hole pair within the multiplication region obeys an arbitrary exponential distribution. The results show that in contrast to the case of edge parent-electron injection, when mixed injection is allowed even a small level of hole ionization (e.g., small k ∼ 0.0001) causes the excess noise factor to increase dramatically, depending on the absorption profile as it ranges from narrow to flat within the multiplication region. The theoretical results are validated against experimental results for Si APDs.},

   abstract = {Photon detection efficiency is a key parameter of PMTs in high-precision neutrino and dark matter experiments, while most of these experiments are focus on quantum efficiency. More and more experiments are trying to know the detection efficiency for the simulation of the detector such as JUNO. In order to have a good understanding on photon detection efficiency of the large-area PMT , we conducted a detailed comparison of the relative collection efficiencies of a series of dynode PMT with different sizes and collector structures. This study is based on the tests of relative quantum efficiency and relative detection efficiency with cross check by several light intensities. The testing and results will be discussed. 1.Introduction Photomultiplier tube (PMT) is an important sensor to count photons and to measure parameters in particle physics experiments. Photon detection efficiency (DE) of PMT is always a key parameter for detector response while DE is a comprehensive effect of quantum efficiency(QE) and collection efficiency (CE)[1], and incident photons with wavelength, area, angle and environment. As known, Quantum efficiency is defined as the process of incident photons that are converted into photoelectrons on the photocathode of PMT through photoelectric process. Then, with the effect of electric field, the photoelectrons are collected by the collector and multiplied by following dynodes where CE is defined to describe the collection fraction. The higher the quantum efficiency and the collection efficiency, the higher detection efficiency and more photoelectrons can be detected. The DE also depends on the PMT structure and the voltage divider [2]. The number of incident photons are difficult to be measured precisely till now and the CE is also hard to measure directly as an internal process. According to the current running and proposed experiments, QE is calibrated by Borexino[3], Daya Bay[4-5] and XENON1T[6] to simulate and guarantee the response of detector, while Double Chooz[2] and IceCube[7] were focusing on the photon detection sensitivity. Double Chooz adopted a relative method to compare the anode signal to a reference tube where CE is 0.9 provided by manufacturer[2]. IceCube applied a calibrated Photodiode to monitor the photon flux and to obtain the relative photon DE of testing tubes[7]. In Daya Bay, 8 inches tubes were used and the QE is measured by the light from a lens and mirror system to cover the whole photocathode[5]. JUNO is a multipurpose experiment to measure neutrino mass hierarchy with reactor antineutrinos, as well as supernovae, geo-neutrino},

   abstract = {Instrumentation for positron emission tomography (PET) imaging has experienced tremendous improvements in performance over the past 60 years since it was first conceived as a medical imaging modality. Spatial resolution has improved by a factor of 10 and sensitivity by a factor of 40 from the early designs in the 1970s to the high-performance scanners of today. Multimodality configurations have emerged that combine PET with computed tomography (CT) and, more recently, with MR. Whole-body scans for clinical purposes can now be acquired in under 10 min on a state-of-the-art PET/CT. This paper will review the history of these technical developments over 40 years and summarize the important clinical research and healthcare applications that have been made possible by these technical advances.

   abstract = {Introduction: This paper analyses the ability of single-photon avalanche diodes (SPADs) for neural imaging. The current trend in the production of SPADs moves toward the minimum dark count rate (DCR) and maximum photon detection probability (PDP). Moreover, the jitter response which is the main measurement characteristic for the timing uncertainty is progressing. Methods: The neural imaging process using SPADs can be performed by means of florescence lifetime imaging (FLIM), time correlated single-photon counting (TCSPC), positron emission tomography (PET), and single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT). Results: This trend will result in more precise neural imaging cameras. While achieving low DCR SPADs is difficult in deep submicron technologies because of using higher doping profiles, higher PDPs are reported in green and blue part of light. Furthermore, the number of pixels integrated in the same chip is increasing with the technology progress which can result in the higher resolution of imaging. Conclusion: This study proposes implemented SPADs in Deep-submicron technologies to be used in neural imaging cameras, due to the small size pixels and higher timing accuracies.},

   abstract = {We present the most recent advances in photo-detector design employed in time of flight positron emission tomography (ToF-PET). PET is a molecular imaging modality that collects pairs of coincident (temporally correlated) annihilation photons emitted from the patient body. The annihilation photon detector typically comprises a scintillation crystal coupled to a fast photo-detector. ToF information provides better localization of the annihilation event along the line formed by each detector pair, resulting in an overall improvement in signal to noise ratio (SNR) of the reconstructed image. Apart from the demand for high luminosity and fast decay time of the scintillation crystal, proper design and selection of the photo-detector and methods for arrival time pick-off are a prerequisite for achieving excellent time resolution required for ToF-PET. We review the two types of photo-detectors used in ToF-PET: photomultiplier tubes (PMTs) and silicon photo-multipliers (SiPMs) with a special focus on SiPMs. © 2010 by the authors; licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.},

   abstract = {The first time-of-flight positron emission tomography (TOF-PET) scanners were developed as early as in the 1980s. However, the poor light output and low detection efficiency of TOF-capable detectors available at the time limited any gain in image quality achieved with these TOF-PET scanners over the traditional non-TOF PET scanners. The discovery of LSO and other Lu-based scintillators revived interest in TOF-PET and led to the development of a second generation of scanners with high sensitivity and spatial resolution in the mid-2000s. The introduction of the silicon photomultiplier (SiPM) has recently yielded a third generation of TOF-PET systems with unprecedented imaging performance. Parallel to these instrumentation developments, much progress has been made in the development of image reconstruction algorithms that better utilize the additional information provided by TOF. Overall, the benefits range from a reduction in image variance (SNR increase), through allowing joint estimation of activity and attenuation, to better reconstructing data from limited angle systems. In this work, we review these developments, focusing on three broad areas: 1) timing theory and factors affecting the time resolution of a TOF-PET system; 2) utilization of TOF information for improved image reconstruction; and 3) quantification of the benefits of TOF compared to non-TOF PET. Finally, we offer a brief outlook on the TOF-PET developments anticipated in the short and longer term. Throughout this work, we aim to maintain a clinically driven perspective, treating TOF as one of multiple (and sometimes competitive) factors that can aid in the optimization of PET imaging performance.},

   abstract = {Positron emission tomography (PET) imaging is an essential tool in clinical applications for the diagnosis of diseases due to its ability to acquire functional images to help differentiate between metabolic and biological activities at the molecular level. One key limiting factor in the development of efficient and accurate PET systems is the sensor technology in the PET detector. There are generally four types of sensor technologies employed: photomultiplier tubes (PMTs), avalanche photodiodes (APDs), silicon photomultipliers (SiPMs), and cadmium zinc telluride (CZT) detectors. PMTs were widely used for PET applications in the early days due to their excellent performance metrics of high gain, low noise, and fast timing. However, the fragility and bulkiness of the PMT glass tubes, high operating voltage, and sensitivity to magnetic fields ultimately limit this technology for future cost-effective and multi-modal systems. As a result, solid-state photodetectors like the APD, SiPM, and CZT detectors, and their applications for PET systems, have attracted lots of research interest, especially owing to the continual advancements in the semiconductor fabrication process. In this review, we study and discuss the operating principles, key performance parameters, and PET applications for each type of sensor technology with an emphasis on SiPM and CZT detectors—the two most promising types of sensors for future PET systems. We also present the sensor technologies used in commercially available state-of-the-art PET systems. Finally, the strengths and weaknesses of these four types of sensors are compared and the research challenges of SiPM and CZT detectors are discussed and summarized.},
